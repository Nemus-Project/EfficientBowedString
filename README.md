# EfficientBowedString
Companion page for the paper *Efficient Simulation of the Bowed String in Modal Form*.

These are sample audios synthesised with the stiff string equation, solved with the efficient modal algorithm as detailed in the paper. The prefix notes indicate which string was played. The suffix `Free` means that the string was bowed and then left free to vibrate: this allows to hear the decaying sound. `Stop` specifies that the string was bowed and then stopped. `5th` indicates that the string base lentgh was reduced of 1/3, thus the output sound corresponds to the pythagorean 5th.
